            <ul>
                <li>Built a meal-selling Android App where local cooks can sell meals to clients from their homes, using Java. The
                    functionality included admin, cook, customer registration/login, add/remove meals and allow customers to rate/review
                    cook. 
                </li>
                <li>Created a Firebase database to store and retrieve user information, enable admins to view customersâ€™ complaints, and
                    allow cooks to edit their menus.
                </li>
